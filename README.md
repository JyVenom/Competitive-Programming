# Competitive-Programming
A repository containing all the code I wrote in the past to solve coding problems online. Starting around 2020, I have transitioned over to C++, and since my submissions are stored on the contest websites, I no longer save my code locally, so you will not find those in this repo.
Each folder represents the contest or website the code in it was written in, with subfolders further dividing the code by contest year or division. 
There may be multiple versions of the same file. These represent the different iterations I went through to get the final passing solution. The version with the largest number should be the lastest (and passing) solution.
